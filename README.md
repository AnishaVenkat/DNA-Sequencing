# DNA-Sequencing
Based on DNA sequence this project classifies whether the DNA is person or dog or chimp

Treating DNA-Sequence as language we apply K-mers to the string and applying Count vectorizer for the list of words in each dataset and for the predicting accuracy we use Accuracy metrics, Precision and Recall score
